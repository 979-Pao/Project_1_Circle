Responsiveness Page
The main page (Home.html) has been made responsive by means of the Home.css page (@media (max-width: 950px)), where the content adapts depending on the width of the screen.

The endpoint was utilized to retrieve data through an asynchronous function (fetch) in order to dynamically inject it into the required fields on the projects page (projects.html) using JavaScript and the DOM. (Document Object Model).
